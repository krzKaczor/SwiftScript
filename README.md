SwiftScript
===========

Swift is awesome, expressive language. Why shouldn't you use it for web development? SwiftScript allows you to run your swift code directly in browser by translating it into JavaScript.

You can for example take models or business logic from your existing swift project, translate it into JavaScript, build some interface upon that and BOOM! Now you have web version of your application.
